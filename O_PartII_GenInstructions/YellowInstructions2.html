<p>You will have 4 tasks again.</p>

    Since this is the same encryption task as in Part 1, you will not have a practice round this time.
</p>

<p>Second, you will complete a short survey about decisions related to the encryption task.</p>

<p>Third, you will be a participant in one decision exercise.</p>

<p>Fourth, you will be asked to answer one survey question related to the study.</p>
