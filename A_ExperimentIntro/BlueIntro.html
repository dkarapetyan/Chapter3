  <b>Overview of Study </b>
  <br />
    Here is a brief overview of the study.
    <br />
 <br />
    <b><u> What will I have to do?</u></b>   <br />
    This study will be divided into <b>two parts</b>. Each part consists of two main tasks along with brief survey questions.
    <br /><br />
    You will now participate in Part 1. After you have completed Part 1, the computer program will
    prompt you to start Part 2 of the study.
    <br /><br />
    Parts 1 and 2 together should take an average of <b>30 minutes</b> to complete in total.
    <br /><br />

    <b> <u>How much payment will I receive for my participation?</u></b>
    <br>You will receive {{ session.config.participation_fee }} as the participation payment for completing  <b>both</b>
    Parts 1 and 2 of the study.<br>
    <br>In addition to the participation payment, you will have the opportunity to receive <b>bonus
    payments</b>. The bonus payments will be based on tokens you earn, which will depend on your performance in the
    main tasks and the decisions you make. Each token will be equal to Â£0.05.</br>
    <br>At the end of the study, the computer program will <b>randomly pick either Part I or Part 2</b>
    to determine your bonus payment.  Since nobody knows which part will be selected for payment,
    you should pay close attention to both parts as your decisions may determine your earnings.</br>
