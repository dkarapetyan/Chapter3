    <b> <u>How much payment will I receive for my participation?</u></b>
    <br>You will receive {{ session.config.participation_fee }} as the participation fee for completing the study.<br>
    <br>You will also have the opportunity to earn additional money.</br>
    <br>
    In this study, we will be using a currency called “tokens”. These tokens will determine your <b>additional
    earnings</b>, which will depend on your performance and the decisions you make. For each token you earn, you will
    be paid £0.05.
    </br>
    <br>At the end of the study, the computer program will <b>randomly pick Part 1, Part 2, or Part 3</b>
    to determine your additional earnings.  Since nobody knows which part will be selected for payment,
    you should pay close attention to all three parts of the study as your decisions may determine your
    earnings.</br>
    <br>Your total payment from this study will be equal to the participation fee plus your additional earnings.</br>
    <br>Let’s say, for example, that the computer program chose the additional earnings from Part 2. If you earned
    100 tokens in total for the task in Part 2, you would be paid £5 (100*0.05) in additional earnings.
    Your total payment would therefore be £8.75 (£3.75 + £5).</br>
