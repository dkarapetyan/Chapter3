    <br><b><u>Player Roles</u></b>
<p>There is a possibility that each word a <b>blue player</b> encrypts correctly <b>may decrease</b> your earnings
    by 1 token.</p>
    <p>Each word <b>you</b> encrypt correctly will <b>not take away tokens</b> from the blue
        player you are paired with.</p>
    <br><b><u>Token Earnings</b></u><br>
    Each word a player encrypts correctly will add  <b>2 tokens</b> to their earnings.<br>
    <br>If any letters within a word are encrypted incorrectly, you will not earn any tokens for that word.</br>
    <br>The maximum number of tokens any player will earn is 64. To earn 64 tokens, 32 words would need to be correctly
     encrypted.</br>
    <br>You will now have a chance to practice the task for 2 minutes, but you will <b>not be paid</b> for the
    practice.</br>
