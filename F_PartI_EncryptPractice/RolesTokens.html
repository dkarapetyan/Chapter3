<p>
    For every word encrypted correctly, <b>2 tokens</b> will be added to your earnings.<br>
    <br>If any letters within a word are encrypted incorrectly, you will not earn any tokens for that word.</br>
    <br>The maximum number of tokens any player will earn is 64. To earn 64 tokens, 32 words would need to be correctly
     encrypted.</br>
    <br>Each word a <b>blue player</b> encrypts correctly will <b>take away 1 token</b> from the paired yellow player.</br>
    <br>Each word a <b>yellow player</b> encrypts correctly will also add 2 tokens to their earnings but will <b>not
    take away tokens</b> from the
    paired blue
    player.</br>
    <br>You will now have a chance to practice the task for 2 minutes, but you will <b>not be paid</b> for the
    practice.</br>
