    Encryption Task Earnings

{{ block content }}

<p>Both Blue and Yellow participants engage in the Encryption task for the additional earnings. The Encryption task lasts for
    <b>8
    minutes</b>,
    and you are free to make as much money as you can.   For each word encrypted correctly, you will earn <b>2 tokens</b>.  You will
    earn nothing for any word encrypted incorrectly. Note that both Yellow and Blue players face the same conditions.
    So, each participant earns 2 tokens for each word encrypted correctly.<br>
    <br>However, there is one additional condition that depends on the roles.  For <b>each word</b> that the <b>Blue
        player encrypts correctly</b>, the <b>Yellow player loses 1 token</b>.  But, the reverse is not true: the number of words
    encrypted correctly by the Yellow player has no effect on the earnings of the Blue player.<br>
    <br>As you are the Yellow player, your earnings are <b>positively</b> affected by your performance in the
    encryption task, <b>but negatively</b> affected by your matched Blue players performance in the encryption task.
    Suppose you were able to encrypt 20 words correctly, while your matched Blue player was able to encrypt 25 words correctly.  This means
    that your earnings from the Encryption task will be (20 * 2 = ) 40 minus (25 * 1 = ) 25 = 15 tokens.  Hence, in this example, the matched
    Blue player would earn (25 * 2 = ) 50 tokens, while you would earn 15 tokens.<br>
