<p>
   For this experiment, individuals participate in pairs. This means that you will be paired with another individual
    participating in the experiment, and that your decisions may impact their earnings, while their decisions may
    impact your earnings.<br>
    <br>Participants have different roles, and to differentiate between them, we have labeled them as the "Blue
    player" and the "Yellow player".<br>
    <ul>
    <br><li>You have been assigned to be the <b>Yellow player</b>.<br></li>
    <br><li>Your counterpart Blue player has been randomly selected. Note that the Blue player has already participated
    in the experiment, but the decisions that you make can still affect their final payment. How the payments are
    affected will be explained on the next screen.<br></ul></li>
