                </div>
                <p>As the <b>Blue player</b>, you will now have a decision to make about your earnings and the earnings
                    of your matched counterpart.
                    You will choose to either earn <b>2 tokens</b> for each word encrypted correctly <b>while taking 1 token away</b> from your matched Yellow player
                    OR earn <b>1.5 tokens</b> for each word encrypted correctly <b>without taking any tokens</b> from
                    your matched Yellow player.</p>
                <p>For each word your matched Yellow player encrypts correctly, 2 tokens will be added to their earnings.  And, once
     again, your matched Yellow playerâ€™s performance will not have any impact on your earnings in the encryption
                    task.</p>
                <p>Suppose you chose to earn 2 tokens, and both you and your matched counterpart encrypted 20 words. As an example, you would then earn (20*2=) 40 tokens and
                    your matched Yellow player would earn (20*2=) 40 minus (20*1=) 20 = 20 tokens.</p>
                <p>Now, suppose you chose to earn 1.5 tokens, and both you and your matched Yellow player encrypted 20 words. You would then earn (20*1.5=) 30 tokens and your
                    matched Yellow player would earn (20*2=) 40 tokens.
