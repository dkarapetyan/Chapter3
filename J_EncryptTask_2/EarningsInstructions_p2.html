                <p>
                    As the <b>Blue player</b>, you will now have a decision to make about your earnings and the earnings
                    of your matched counterpart.
                    You will choose to either earn <b>2 tokens</b> for each word encrypted correctly <b>while taking 1 token away</b> from your matched Yellow player
                    OR earn <b>1.5 tokens</b> for each word encrypted correctly <b>without taking any tokens away</b>
                    from your matched Yellow player.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For each word your matched Yellow player encrypts correctly, 2 tokens will be added to their earnings.  And, once again, your matched
                    Yellow player’s performance will not have any impact on your earnings in the encryption task.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are <b>three different scenarios</b> of what impact your performance and your matched Yellow player’s performance could have on
                    additional earnings:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suppose both you and your matched Yellow player were both able to encrypt 20 words correctly. Now
                    further suppose that you chose the payoff scheme that would have no effect on your matched Yellow player’s earnings.
                    This means that your earnings from the Encryption task would be (20 x 1.5 =) 30 tokens. In this example, your matched Yellow player
                    would earn (20 x 2 =) 40 tokens, while you would earn 30 tokens. On the other hand, if you chose the payoff that would decrease your
                    matched Yellow player’s earnings, your earnings from the Encryption task would be (20 x 2 =) 40 tokens.  Hence, in this example, the
                    matched Yellow player would earn (20 x 2 =) 40 minus (20 x 1 =) 20  = 20 tokens, while you would earn 40 tokens.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, suppose you were able to encrypt 25 words correctly, while your matched Yellow player was able to encrypt 20 words correctly.
                    Now further suppose that you chose the payoff scheme that would have no effect on your matched Yellow player’s earnings. This means that
                    your earnings from the Encryption task would be (25 x 1.5=) 37.5 tokens. In this example, your matched Yellow player would earn
                    (20 x 2 =) 40 tokens, while you would earn 37.5 tokens. However, if you chose the payoff scheme that would decrease your matched
                    Yellow player’s earnings, your earnings from the Encryption task would be (25 x 2 =) 50 tokens. Hence, in this example, the matched
                    Yellow player would earn (20 x 2 =) 40 minus (25 x 1 =) 25 = 15 tokens, while you would earn 50 tokens.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a last example, suppose you were only able to encrypt 5 words correctly, while your matched Yellow player was able to encrypt 20
                    words correctly. Now further suppose that you chose the payoff scheme that would have no effect on your matched Yellow player’s
                    earnings. This means that your earnings from the Encryption task would be (5 x 1.5 =) 7.5 tokens.
                    In this example, your matched Yellow player would earn (20 x 2 =) 40 tokens, while you would earn 7.5 tokens. However, if you chose the
                    payoff scheme that would decrease your matched Yellow player’s earnings, your earnings from the Encryption task would be (5 x 2 =)
                    10 tokens. Hence, in this example, the matched Yellow player would earn (20 x 2 =) 40 minus (5 x 1 =) 5 = 35 tokens, while you would
                    earn 10 tokens.
