                </div>
                <p>
                    Both Blue and Yellow participants engage in the Encryption task for their additional earnings. The Encryption
                    task lasts for <b>6 minutes</b>, and you are free to make as much money as you can.   For each word encrypted
                    correctly, you will earn <b>2 tokens</b>.  You will earn nothing for any word encrypted incorrectly. Note that
                    both Yellow and Blue players face the same conditions. So, each participant earns 2 tokens for each word
                    encrypted correctly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, there is one additional condition that depends on the roles. Each word <b>you (as the
                    Blue player)</b> encrypt will <b>take away 1 token</b> from the earnings of the Yellow player you
                    will be matched with. But, the reverse is not true: the number of words encrypted correctly by
                    the Yellow player has no effect on the earnings of the Blue player.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an example, if <b>you (as the Blue player)</b> encrypt 20 words correctly, your counterpart
                    Yellow playerâ€™s earnings will be decreased by 20 tokens.
