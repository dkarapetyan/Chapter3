    Part 2: Encryption Task Instructions

{{ block content }}

<p><br>The first task in Part 2 will be similar to Part 1. You will be shown a 5-letter word block that you will
encode into 5 numbers. As you can see in the screenshot below, the first letter in the word is "P". The letter "P"
corresponds to the number "322" in the encoding table at the bottom of the screen. To complete this letter correctly, you should put
    the number "322" into the box below the letter "P".</br>

    <br>After you finish encoding a word, the computer program will prompt you with another word to encode. Once you encode that word, you will be given another word, and so on.</br>
    <br>This process will continue for 8 minutes (480 seconds).</br>
