<p>
    Each word a <b>yellow player</b> encrypts correctly will <b>add 2 tokens</b> to their earnings, and will <b>not take away tokens</b> from
    the blue player.</br>
    <br>As the <b>blue player</b>, you will have a decision to make in your token earnings for Part 2.
    You will choose to either earn <b>2 tokens</b> for each word encrypted correctly <b>while taking 1 token away</b>
    from the yellow player OR earn <b>1.5 tokens</b> for each word encrypted correctly <b>without taking any tokens</b>
    from the yellow player.</br>
    <br>If any letters within a word are encrypted incorrectly, no tokens will be earned for that
    word.</br>
    <br>The maximum number of tokens any player will earn is 64. To earn 64 tokens, 32 words would need to be correctly
    encrypted.</br>
