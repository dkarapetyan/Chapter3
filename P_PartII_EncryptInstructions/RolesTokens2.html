    <br><b><u>Roles</u></b>
    <br>If you are a <b>yellow player</b>, your token earnings <b>may or may not</b> be decreased by 1 token each time a
    blue player correctly encrypts a word in this Part 2.</br>
    <br>Similar to Part 1, yellow players cannot take away any tokens from blue players.</br>

    <br><b><u>Token Earnings</u></b></br>
      Each 5-letter word block encrypted correctly will add 2 tokens to your score. All letters within the
    5-letter word block need to be encrypted correctly to earn any tokens for a word.<br>
    <br>If any letters are encrypted incorrectly within a word, you will not earn any tokens for that word.</br>
