                        Both Blue and Yellow participants engage in the Encryption task for their additional earnings.
                        The Encryption task lasts for 6 minutes, and you are free to make as much money as you can.
                        For each word encrypted correctly, you will earn 2 tokens. You will earn nothing for any word
                        encrypted incorrectly. Note that both Yellow and Blue players face the same conditions. So, each
                        participant earns 2 tokens for each word encrypted correctly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, there is one additional condition that depends on the roles.  For each word that the
                        Blue player encrypts correctly, the Yellow player loses 1 token. But, the reverse is not true:
                        the number of words encrypted correctly by the Yellow player has no effect on the earnings
                        of the Blue player.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As you are the Yellow player, your earnings are positively affected by your performance
                        in the encryption task, but negatively affected by your matched Blue player’s performance in
                        the encryption task. Note that before the Blue player began the encryption task, the Blue player
                        was also told how their performance would impact the player they would be matched with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the next screen, you will be provided with three different scenarios of what impact
                        your performance and your matched Blue player’s performance will have on additional earnings.

                        <b>Equal Performance</b>
                        <p>
                            Suppose both you and your matched Blue player were able to encrypt 20 words correctly.
                            This means that your earnings from the Encryption task will be (20 × 2) = 40 minus (20 × 1) = 20  = 20 tokens.
                            Hence, in this example, the matched Blue player would earn (20 × 2) = 40 tokens, while you would earn 20 tokens.
                        </p>
                        <b>Better Performance by Blue Player</b>
                        <p>
                            Now, suppose you were able to encrypt 20 words correctly, while your matched Blue player was able to
                            encrypt 25 words correctly.  This means that your earnings from the Encryption task will be (20 × 2 =) 40 minus
                            (25 × 1 =) 25 = 15 tokens.  Hence, in this example, the matched Blue player would earn (25 × 2 =) 50 tokens,
                            while you would earn 15 tokens.
                        </p>
                        <b>Better Performance by Yellow Player</b>
                        <p>
                            As a last example, suppose you were able to encrypt 20 words correctly, while your matched Blue player
                            was only able to encrypt 5 words correctly.  This means that your earnings from the Encryption task will be
                            (20 × 2 =) 40 minus (5 × 1 =) 5 = 35 tokens.  Hence, in this example, the matched Blue player would earn
                            (5 × 2 =) 10 tokens, while you would earn 35 tokens.
