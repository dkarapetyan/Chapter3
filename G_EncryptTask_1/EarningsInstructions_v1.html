                Both Blue and Yellow players engage in the Encryption task for their additional earnings. For each
                    word encrypted correctly, you will earn 2 tokens.
                    You are free to earn as many tokens as you can during the 6-minute encryption task. You will earn nothing for any word encrypted incorrectly.
                    Note that both Yellow and Blue players face the same conditions. So, <b>each player earns 2 tokens
                    for each word encrypted correctly</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, there is one additional condition that depends on the roles.  For <b>each word</b> your
                    matched <b>Blue player encrypted correctly,
                    you (as the Yellow player) lose 1 token</b> from your earnings.  But, the reverse is not true: the
                    number of words encrypted correctly by the
                    Yellow player has no effect on the earnings of the Blue player.
                </p>
                    <p>
                        As you are the Yellow player, your earnings are <b>positively affected</b> by your performance
                        in the encryption task, <b>but negatively affected</b> by your matched Blue player’s
                        performance in the encryption task. Note that the Blue player was also told that their performance would negatively impact the earnings of the
                        Yellow player before they began the encryption task.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the next screen, you will be provided with three different scenarios of what impact
                        your performance and your matched Blue player’s performance will have on additional earnings.

                    <h1 class="card-title font-weight-bold">Encryption Task Earnings Examples</h1>
                </div>
                        <p>
                            Suppose both you and your matched Blue player were able to encrypt 20 words correctly.
                            This means that your earnings from the Encryption task will be (20 × 2) = 40 minus (20 × 1) = 20  = 20 tokens.
                            Hence, in this example, the matched Blue player would earn (20 × 2) = 40 tokens, while you would earn 20 tokens.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, suppose you were able to encrypt 20 words correctly, while your matched Blue player was able to
                            encrypt 25 words correctly.  This means that your earnings from the Encryption task will be (20 × 2 =) 40 minus
                            (25 × 1 =) 25 = 15 tokens.  Hence, in this example, the matched Blue player would earn (25 × 2 =) 50 tokens,
                            while you would earn 15 tokens.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a last example, suppose you were able to encrypt 20 words correctly, while your matched Blue player
                            was only able to encrypt 5 words correctly.  This means that your earnings from the Encryption task will be
                            (20 × 2 =) 40 minus (5 × 1 =) 5 = 35 tokens.  Hence, in this example, the matched Blue player would earn
                            (5 × 2 =) 10 tokens, while you would earn 35 tokens.
