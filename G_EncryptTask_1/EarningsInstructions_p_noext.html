                        Instructions</h1>

                    <p>
                        Both Blue and Yellow players engage in the Encryption task for their additional earnings. You are free to earn as many tokens as you can
                        during the 6-minute Encryption task. You will earn nothing for any word encrypted incorrectly. Note that both Yellow and Blue players face the
                        same conditions in this task, except for the payoff amount.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For each word encrypted correctly by <b>you (the Blue player)</b>, you will earn <b>1.5 tokens</b>. But, for each word
                        your matched <b>Yellow player</b> encrypts correctly, 2 tokens will be earned.
                    </p>
                <p>Your performance will not have any effect on your matched Yellow player’s earnings. And, the reverse
                    is also true: your matched Yellow player’s performance will not have any impact your earnings.</p>

                    <p>
                        As an example, suppose both you and your counterpart Yellow player encrypt 20 words correctly.  Your additional earnings for this task would then equal to
                        30 tokens (20*1.5), while your counterpart Yellow player’s earnings would equal 40 tokens (20*2).
