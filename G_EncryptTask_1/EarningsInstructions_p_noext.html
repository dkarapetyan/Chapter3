                    <p>
                        Both Blue and Yellow players engage in the Encryption task for their additional earnings. You are free to earn as many tokens as you can
                        during the 6-minute Encryption task. You will earn nothing for any word encrypted incorrectly. Note that both Yellow and Blue players face the
                        same conditions in this task, except for the payoff amount.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For each word encrypted correctly by <b>you (the Blue player)</b>, you will earn <b>1.5 tokens</b>. But, for each word
                        encrypted correctly by your matched <b>Yellow player</b>, the Yellow player will earn 2 tokens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your performance will not have any effect on your matched Yellow player’s earnings. And, the reverse
                        is also true: your matched Yellow player’s performance will not have any impact your earnings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here are <b>three different scenarios</b> of what impact your performance and your matched Yellow player’s performance will have on
                        additional earnings:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Suppose both you and your matched Yellow player were able to encrypt 20 words correctly. This means that your earnings from the
                        Encryption task would be (20 x 1.5 =) 30 tokens. Hence, in this example, your matched Yellow player would earn (20 x 2 =) 40 tokens,
                        while you would earn 30 tokens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, suppose you were able to encrypt 25 words correctly, while your matched Yellow player was able to encrypt 20 words correctly.
                        This means that your earnings from the Encryption task would be (25 x 1.5 =) 37.5 tokens. Hence, in this example, the matched
                        Yellow player would earn (20 x 2 =) 40 tokens, while you would earn 37.5 tokens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a last example, suppose you were only able to encrypt 5 words correctly, while your matched Yellow player was able to encrypt 20
                        words correctly. This means that your earnings from the Encryption task would be (5 x 1.5 =) 7.5 tokens.
                        Hence, in this example, the matched Yellow player would earn (20 x 2 =) 40 tokens, while you
                        would earn 7.5 tokens.
