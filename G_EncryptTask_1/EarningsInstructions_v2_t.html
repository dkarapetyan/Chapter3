                    <p>
                        Both Blue and Yellow participants engage in the Encryption task for their additional earnings.
                        The Encryption task lasts for 6 minutes, and you are free to make as much money as you can.
                        For each word encrypted correctly, you will earn 2 tokens. You will earn nothing for any word
                        encrypted incorrectly. Note that both Yellow and Blue players face the same conditions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, there is one additional condition that depends on the roles. The Blue player will have
                        made a choice between two payoff schemes prior to participating in the encryption task.
                        Depending on the choice your matched Blue player made, your earnings may be negatively affected
                        by their performance in the encryption task. But, the reverse is not true: the Yellow player
                        has no payoff scheme choice to make.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Blue player had to choose between the following:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For each word encrypted correctly, the Blue player may add 2 tokens to their earnings but
                            the Yellow player loses 1 token.</li>
                        <li>For each word encrypted correctly, the Blue player may add 1.5 tokens to their earnings
                            with no effect on the Yellow player earnings.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        As you are the Yellow player, your earnings are positively affected by your performance in the
                        encryption task, but might be negatively affected by your matched Blue player’s performance in
                        the encryption task depending on the choice they make. Note that before the Blue player began
                        the encryption task, the Blue player was also told how their performance would impact the
                        player they would be matched with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the next screen, you will be provided with three different scenarios of what impact your
                        performance and your matched Blue player’s performance will have on additional earnings if the
                        Blue player did choose the payoff scheme that would decrease your earnings.

                    <h3 class="card-title font-weight-bold">Encryption Task Earnings Instructions</h3>
                </div>
                        <p>The following earning example only applies if your matched Blue player chose the payoff
                            scheme that would decrease your earnings:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Equal Performance</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Suppose both you and your matched Blue player were able to encrypt 20 words correctly.
                            This means that your earnings from the Encryption task will be (20 × 2) = 40 minus (20 × 1) = 20  = 20 tokens.
                            Hence, in this example, the matched Blue player would earn (20 × 2) = 40 tokens, while you would earn 20 tokens.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Better Performance by Blue Player</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, suppose you were able to encrypt 20 words correctly, while your matched Blue player was able to
                            encrypt 25 words correctly.  This means that your earnings from the Encryption task will be (20 × 2 =) 40 minus
                            (25 × 1 =) 25 = 15 tokens.  Hence, in this example, the matched Blue player would earn (25 × 2 =) 50 tokens,
                            while you would earn 15 tokens.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Better Performance by Yellow Player</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a last example, suppose you were able to encrypt 20 words correctly, while your matched Blue player
                            was only able to encrypt 5 words correctly.  This means that your earnings from the Encryption task will be
                            (20 × 2 =) 40 minus (5 × 1 =) 5 = 35 tokens.  Hence, in this example, the matched Blue player would earn
                            (5 × 2 =) 10 tokens, while you would earn 35 tokens.
