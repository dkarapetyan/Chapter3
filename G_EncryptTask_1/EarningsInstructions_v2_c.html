                    <p>
                        Both Blue and Yellow participants engage in the Encryption task for their additional earnings.
                        The Encryption task lasts for 6 minutes, and you are free to make as much money as you can.
                        For each word encrypted correctly, you will earn 2 tokens. You will earn nothing for any word
                        encrypted incorrectly. Note that both Yellow and Blue players face the same conditions. So, each
                        participant earns 2 tokens for each word encrypted correctly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, there is one additional condition that depends on the roles. The Blue player will
                        have been randomly assigned by the computer program to have one of two payoff schemes prior to
                        participating in the encryption task. Depending on which payoff scheme your matched Blue player
                        was assigned to, your earnings may be negatively affected by their performance in the
                        encryption task.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <b>computer program</b> has randomly assigned the <b>Blue player</b> to one of the following
                        payoff schemes:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            For each word encrypted correctly, <b>2 tokens are added to the Blue player</b> earnings
                            but the <b>Yellow player loses 1 token.</b>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For each word encrypted correctly, <b>1.5 tokens are added to the Blue player</b> earnings
                            with <b>no effect on the Yellow player’s earnings.</b>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        As you are the Yellow player, your earnings are <b>positively affected</b> by your performance
                        in the encryption task, but <b>might be negatively affected</b> by your matched Blue
                        player’s performance in the encryption task <b>depending on the random assignment of the
                        computer program</b>. Note that before the Blue player began the encryption task, the Blue
                        player was also told how their performance would impact the Yellow player they would be matched
                        with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the next screen, you will be provided with three different scenarios of what impact
                        your performance and your matched Blue player’s performance will have on additional
                        earnings if the Blue player did get assigned the payoff scheme that would decrease
                        your earnings.

                </div>
                <p>
                    The following are earnings examples <b>only if the computer program</b> matched you
                    with a Blue player whose payoff scheme would decrease your earnings.
                </p>
                <b>Equal Performance</b>
                <p>
                    Suppose both you and your matched Blue player were able to encrypt 20 words correctly.
                    This means that your earnings from the Encryption task will be (20 × 2) = 40 minus (20 × 1) = 20  = 20 tokens.
                    Hence, in this example, the matched Blue player would earn (20 × 2) = 40 tokens, while you would earn 20 tokens.
                </p>
                <b>Better Performance by Blue Player</b>
                <p>
                    Now, suppose you were able to encrypt 20 words correctly, while your matched Blue player was able to
                    encrypt 25 words correctly.  This means that your earnings from the Encryption task will be (20 × 2 =) 40 minus
                    (25 × 1 =) 25 = 15 tokens.  Hence, in this example, the matched Blue player would earn (25 × 2 =) 50 tokens,
                    while you would earn 15 tokens.
                </p>
                <b>Better Performance by Yellow Player</b>
                <p>
                    As a last example, suppose you were able to encrypt 20 words correctly, while your matched Blue player
                    was only able to encrypt 5 words correctly.  This means that your earnings from the Encryption task will be
                    (20 × 2 =) 40 minus (5 × 1 =) 5 = 35 tokens.  Hence, in this example, the matched Blue player would earn
                    (5 × 2 =) 10 tokens, while you would earn 35 tokens.
