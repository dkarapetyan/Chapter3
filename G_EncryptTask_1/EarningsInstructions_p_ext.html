                </div>
                <p>
                   Both Blue and Yellow players engage in the encryption task for their additional earnings. For each
                    word encrypted correctly, you will earn 2 tokens. You are free to earn as many tokens as
                    you can during the 6-minute encryption task.
                    You will earn nothing for any word encrypted incorrectly. Note that both Yellow and Blue players
                    face the same conditions. So, <b>each player earns
                    2 tokens for each word encrypted correctly</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, there is one additional condition that depends on the roles. For <b>each word you (as the
                    Blue player) encrypt correctly</b>, your matched Yellow player <b>loses 1 token</b> from their
                    earnings. But, the reverse is not true: the number of words encrypted correctly by the Yellow player has no effect on the earnings
                    of the Blue player.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are <b>three different scenarios</b> of what impact your performance and your matched Yellow playerâ€™s performance will have on
                    additional earnings:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suppose both you and your matched Yellow player encrypt 20 words correctly. This means that your earnings from the Encryption task will
                    be (20 x 2=) 40 tokens. Hence, in this example, the matched Yellow player would earn(20 x 2=) 40 minus (20 x 1=) 20 tokens=20 tokens,
                    while you would earn 40 tokens.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, suppose you were able to encrypt 25 words correctly, while your matched Yellow player was able to encrypt 20 words correctly.
                    This means that your earnings from the Encryption task will be (25 x 2 =) 50 tokens. Hence, in this example, the matched Yellow player
                    would earn (20 x 2 =) 40 minus (25 x 1 =) 25 = 15 tokens, while you would earn 15 tokens.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a last example, suppose you were only able to encrypt 5 words correctly, while your matched Yellow player was able to encrypt 20
                    words correctly.  This means that your earnings from the Encryption task will be (5 x 2 =) 10 tokens.  Hence, in this example, the
                    matched Yellow player would earn (20 x 2 =) 40 minus (5 x 1 =) 5 = 35 tokens, while you would earn 10 tokens.
