                        Instructions</h1>
                </div>
                <p>
                   Both Blue and Yellow players engage in the encryption task for their additional earnings. For each
                    word encrypted correctly, you will earn 2 tokens. You are free to earn as many tokens as
                    you can during the 6-minute encryption task.
                    You will earn nothing for any word encrypted incorrectly. Note that both Yellow and Blue players
                    face the same conditions. So, <b>each player earns
                    2 tokens for each word encrypted correctly</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, there is one additional condition that depends on the roles. For <b>each word you (as the
                    Blue player) encrypt correctly</b>, your matched Yellow player <b>loses 1 token</b> from their
                    earnings. But, the reverse is not true: the number of words encrypted correctly by the Yellow player has no effect on the earnings
                    of the Blue player.
                </p>
                <p>
                As an example, suppose both you and your matched Yellow player encrypt 20 words correctly.  Your
                    additional earnings for this task would then equal to (20*2=) 40 tokens. But, your counterpart Yellow player’s earnings will be decreased
                    by the number of words you encrypted correctly. This means that your counterpart Yellow player’s additional
                    earnings would equal to (20*2=) 40 minus (20*1=) 20 = 20 tokens.
