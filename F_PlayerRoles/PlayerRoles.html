    Encryption Task Player Roles

    <p>
        For this experiment, individuals participate in pairs. This means that you will be paired with another
        individual participating in the experiment, and that your decisions may impact their earnings, while their
        decisions may impact your earnings.
    </p>
    <p>
        Participants have different roles, and to differentiate between them, we have labeled them as the "Blue player"
        and the "Yellow player".

    <ul>
        <li>You have been assigned to be the <b>Blue player</b>.</li>
        <li>Your counterpart Yellow player will be randomly matched with you for each encryption task that you
            participate in.  This means that once you complete a 6-minute encryption task, the next 6-minute encryption
            task you participate in will be with another Yellow player.</li>
    </ul>

{{ else }}

    <ul>
        <li>You have been assigned to be the <b>Yellow player</b>.</li>
        <li>Your counterpart Blue player has been randomly selected. Note that the Blue player has already participated
            in the experiment, but the decisions that you make can still affect their final payment. How the payments
            are affected will be explained on the next screen.</li>
