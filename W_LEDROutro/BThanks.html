<p>Thank you for your participation!</p>
<p>The computer program has randomly chosen
    <b>Part
    {{ if player.participant.random_part == "I" }}1
    {{ else }}2
    {{ endif }}
    </b> to compute your bonus payments.
</p>
<p>You correctly encrypted
    {{ if player.participant.random_part == "I" }}{{ player.participant.performance_I }} words in Part 1. Your bonus
    payment for the encryption task will thus be <b>{{player.participant.tokens_I}} tokens</b>.
    {{ else }}
    {{ player.participant.performance_II }} words in Part 2. Your bonus payment for the encryption task will thus be
    <b>{{player.participant.tokens_II}} tokens</b>.
    {{ endif }}
<p>One token is equal to Â£0.05 </p>
    <p>You may receive an additional bonus payment depending on the decision the yellow player you were paired with
        made in either Part 1 or Part 2.</p>

<p><b>You have now completed the study, and your bonus payments will be processed within 21 days.</b></p>
