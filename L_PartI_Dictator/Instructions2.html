<p> For the transfer example, suppose you wanted to transfer 8 tokens to your matched Blue player. This means you would
    earn (30 -
    8 = ) 22 tokens from this task,
    and the matched Blue player would earn (15 + 8 = ) 23 tokens from this task.<br>
    <br>For the take away/negative transfer example, suppose you wanted to take away 11 tokens from your matched Blue
    player. This means you would earn (30 + 11 = ) 42 tokens from this task, and the matched Blue player would earn (15 - 11 = ) 4 tokens from
    this task.<br>
</p>
<p>Your total payment from this study will be the sum of your participation fee for completion of the study, your encryption task earnings,
    and your earnings from this decision task.</p>
<p>Likewise, the Blue playerâ€™s total payment from this study will be the sum of their participation fee for completion of the study, their encryption
    task earnings, and their earnings outcome from this decision task.</p>
