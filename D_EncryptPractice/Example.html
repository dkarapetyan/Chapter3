    <br>In this task, you will be shown a 5-letter word that you will encode into 5 numbers. As you can see in the
    screenshot below, the first letter in the word is "P". The letter "P" corresponds to the
    number "322" in the encoding table at the bottom of the screen. To complete this letter correctly, you should put
the number "322" into the box below the letter "P", either by <b>typing the number or using copy-paste</b>. You
need to
complete encoding all 5 letters
in the word
correctly to have a correct answer.</br>

<br>After you finish encoding a word, the computer program will prompt you with another word to encode. Once you encode that word, you will be given another word, and so on.</br>
<br>You will now have a chance to practice the task for 2 minutes total, but you will not be paid for the
practice. The practice will consist of two rounds and each round will last 1 minute.</br>
<br><p><b>The practice rounds will notify you whenever errors are made, while the earnings round will not.</b></p>
