<p>Thank you for your participation!</p>
<p>The computer program has randomly chosen <b>Part {{ player.participant.random_part }} </b> to compute your bonus
    payments.
</p>
<p>
    You correctly encrypted {{ player.participant.performance_final }} words in Part
    {{ player.participant.random_part }}. Your bonus payment for the encryption task will thus be
    <b>{{player.participant.payoff_final}} tokens</b>.
</p>
<p>
    One token is equal to Â£0.05.
</p>
<p>
    You may receive an additional bonus payment depending on the decision the yellow player you were paired with
    made in either Part 1 or Part 2.
</p>
<p>
    <b>You have now completed the study, and your bonus payments will be processed within 21 days.</b>
