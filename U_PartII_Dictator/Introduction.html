<p>
    This task is once again a decision exercise that will be made by <b>yellow players</b> only.<br>

    <br>The decision in this task will be with the <b>same matched counterpart</b> as in the beginning of Part
    2.
    <br>

<br>You will not be told who you were matched with during or after this experiment, and your matched counterpart will not be told who you are either during or after the experiment.<br>

    <br><b>The decision made will be strictly anonymous and cannot be linked to the yellow player in any way.</b><br>
