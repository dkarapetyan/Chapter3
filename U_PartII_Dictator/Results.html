<p>Since you are the blue player, you don’t need to make any decision in this task.</p>
<p>The yellow player will be given a certain sum of money in this decision exercise, and will decide on how
    much money, if any, to transfer to the blue player.</p>
<p>The yellow player’s allocation decision, along with any adjustments that need to be made to your bonus payment for this task, will be provided to you within 21 days.</p>
<p><b>You will not immediately know what your total additional bonus payment will be until the yellow player’s decision is made.</b></p>
