<p>For the <b>positive transfer</b> example, suppose you wanted to transfer 8 tokens to your matched Blue player. This
    means you would earn (30 - 8 = ) 22 tokens from this task, and your matched Blue player would earn (15 + 8 = ) 23
    tokens from this task.</p>
<p>For the <b>negative transfer</b> example, suppose you wanted to take away 11 tokens from your matched Blue player.
    This means you would earn (30 + 11 = ) 42 tokens from this task, and your matched Blue player would earn (15 - 11
    = ) 4 tokens from this task.</p>
<p>Your total payment from this study will be the sum of your participation fee for completion of the study, your
    additional earnings from the Encryption task, and your additional earnings from this Decision task.</p>

<p>Likewise, the Blue playerâ€™s total payment from this study will be the sum of their participation fee for
completion of the study, their additional earnings from the Encryption task, and their additional earnings outcome from this Decision task.</p>
