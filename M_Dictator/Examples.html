<p>For the <b>positive transfer</b> example, suppose you wanted to transfer 10 tokens to your matched Blue player.
    Your earnings in this task would be (30 - 10=) 20 tokens, while the Blue player would earn (15 + 10=) 25 tokens.</p>
<p>For the <b>negative transfer</b> example, suppose you wanted to take away 10 tokens from your matched Blue player.
    Your earnings in this task would be (30 + 10=) 40 tokens, the Blue player would earn (15 - 10=) 5 tokens.</p>
<p>Your total payment from this study will be the sum of your participation fee for completion of the study, your
    earnings from the Encryption task, and your earnings from this Decision task.</p>
<p>Likewise, the matched Blue playerâ€™s total payment from this study will be the sum of their participation fee for
completion of the study, their earnings from the Encryption task, and their earnings outcome from this Decision task.</p>
